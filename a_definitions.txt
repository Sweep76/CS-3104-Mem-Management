1. First Fit:
Definition: First Fit is a memory allocation algorithm where the operating system allocates the first available block of memory that is large enough to accommodate a process.

Process:

The OS starts from the beginning of the memory and allocates the first block that is large enough to hold the process.
The size of the allocated block is adjusted to match the size of the process.
If the allocated block is larger than the process, the remaining portion becomes a free block.
Example:
Consider a memory with the following free blocks: [100KB, 50KB, 200KB, 80KB]. If a process of 120KB arrives, First Fit would allocate the first block of 100KB.

2. Next Fit:
Definition: Next Fit is similar to First Fit, but instead of starting from the beginning every time, it continues the search for a suitable block from the point where the last allocation occurred.

Process:

The OS starts the search for a suitable block from the last allocated block.
It continues searching until a block that is large enough is found.
The size of the allocated block is adjusted, and if there is a remaining portion, it becomes a free block.
Example:
Using the same memory blocks as in the First Fit example, if a process of 120KB arrives after allocating the first block, Next Fit would start the search from the second block of 50KB.

3. Best Fit:
Definition: Best Fit is a memory allocation algorithm that allocates the smallest available block that is large enough to hold the process.

Process:

The OS searches for the smallest block that can accommodate the process.
If the found block is larger than the process, it is split into two parts â€“ the allocated block and the remaining free block.
Example:
Using the same memory blocks, if a process of 120KB arrives, Best Fit would allocate the 200KB block and split it into a 120KB allocated block and a 80KB free block.

4. Worst Fit:
Definition: Worst Fit is a memory allocation algorithm that allocates the largest available block to the process.

Process:

The OS searches for the largest block that can accommodate the process.
The allocated block is adjusted to match the size of the process, and any remaining portion becomes a free block.
Example:
Using the same memory blocks, if a process of 120KB arrives, Worst Fit would allocate the 200KB block.
